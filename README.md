# Emacs and desktop configuration files

I use it for bootstrapping my development environment.
I use Makefile to install utils that I use, configure desktop nd emacs (currently spacemacs).
Excpected that ubuntu is my OS. Maybe debian will work ok too

It can install and setup for me:

- spacemacs
- nvm
- bash shell and fish with fisher
- python utils: mycli, pgcli
- utils for linting, ternjs

Run `make` for more info
